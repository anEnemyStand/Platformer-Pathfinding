# Platformer-Pathfinding
A solo game development project where the focus was programming a pathfinding script that would accomodate each unit type regardless of size. The program allows you to point to any node in the level, which is the area above any ground object in the level. If it is possible for the player to reach it, the script will formulate a path, factoring in variables such as jump height, size of player, and gravity. This project was coded in Gamemaker, using the GameMaker Language (GML).
