# Platformer-Pathfinding
A solo game development project where the focus was programming a pathfinding script that would accomodate each unit type regardless of size. The program allows you to point to any node in the level, and if it is possible for the player to reach it, the script will formulate a path, factoring in variables such as jump height and gravity.
